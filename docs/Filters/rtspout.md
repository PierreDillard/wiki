# RTSP Server  
  
Register name used to load filter: __rtspout__  
This filter may be automatically loaded during graph resolution.  
  
The RTSP server partially implements RTSP 1.0, with support for OPTIONS, DESCRIBE, SETUP, PLAY, PAUSE and TEARDOWN.  
Multiple PLAY ranges are not supported, PLAY range end is not supported, PAUSE range is not supported.  
Only aggregated control is supported for PLAY and PAUSE, PAUSE/PLAY on single stream is not supported.  
The server only runs on TCP, and handles request in sequence: it will not probe for commands until previous response is sent.  
The server supports both RTP over UDP delivery and RTP interleaved over RTSP delivery.  
  
The scheduling algorithm and RTP options are the same as the RTP output filter, see [gpac -h rtpout](rtpout)  
The server will disconnect UDP streaming sessions if no RTCP traffic has been received for [timeout](#timeout) seconds.  
  
The server can run over TLS by specifying [cert](#cert) and [pkey](#pkey), in which case the default [port](#port) is 322.  
  
# Sink mode  
  
The filter can work as a simple output filter by specifying the [dst](#dst) option:  
Example
```
gpac -i source -o rtsp://myip/sessionname  
gpac -i source -o rtsp://myip/sessionname
```  
In this mode, only one session is possible. It is possible to [loop](#loop) the input source(s).  
  
# Server mode  
  
The filter can work as a regular RTSP server by specifying the [mounts](#mounts) option to indicate paths of media file to be served:  
Example
```
gpac rtspout:mounts=mydir1,mydir2
```  
In this case, content `RES` from any of the specified directory is exposed as `rtsp://SERVER/RES`  
  
The [mounts](#mounts) option can also specify access rule file(s), see `gpac -h creds`. When rules are used:  

- if a directory has a `name` rule, it will be used in the URL  
- otherwise, the directory is directly available under server root `/`  
- only read access and multicast rights are checked  

Example
```
[foodir]  
name=bar
```  
Content `RES` of this directory is exposed as `rtsp://SERVER/bar/RES`.  
    
  
In this mode, it is possible to load any source supported by gpac by setting the option [dynurl](#dynurl).  
The expected syntax of the dynamic RTSP URLs is `rtsp://servername/?URL1[&URLN]` or `rtsp://servername/@URL1[@URLN]`   
Each URL can be absolute or local, in which case it is resolved against the mount point(s).  
Example
```
gpac -i rtsp://localhost/?pipe://mynamepipe&myfile.mp4 [dst filters]
```  
The server will resolve this URL in a new session containing streams from `myfile.mp4` and streams from pipe `mynamepipe`.  
When setting [runfor](#runfor) in server mode, the server will exit at the end of the last session being closed.  
  
The parameter `name=VAL` is reserved to assign a session name in case multicast mirroring is used.  
Example
```
gpac -i rtsp://localhost/?name=live?pipe://mynamepipe&myfile.mp4 [dst filters]
```  
  
Usage of dynamic URLs can also be configured using the specific directory `$dynurl` in an access rule file.  
EX[$dynurl]  
ru=foo  
This will allow dynamic URLs only for `foo` user.  
  
_Note: If the [dynurl](#dynurl) is set, it is enabled for all users, without authentication._  
  
# Multicasting  
  
In both modes, clients can setup multicast if the [mcast](#mcast) option is `on` or `mirror`.  
When [mcast](#mcast) is set to `mirror` mode, any DESCRIBE command on a resource already delivered through a multicast session will use that multicast.  
Consequently, only DESCRIBE methods are processed for such sessions, other methods will return Unauthorized.  
  
In server mode, multicast can be enabled per read directory using the `mcast` access rule of the directory configuration - see `gpac -h creds`.  
  
# HTTP Tunnel  
  
The server mode supports handling RTSP over HTTP tunnel by default. This can be disabled using [htun](#htun).  
The tunnel conforms to QT specification, and only HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 tunnels are supported.
