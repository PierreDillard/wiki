# Importing Options  
  
# File importing  
  
Syntax is [-add](#add) / [-cat](#cat) `URL[#FRAGMENT][:opt1...:optN=val]`  
This process will create the destination file if not existing, and add the track(s) to it. If you wish to always create a new destination file, add [-new](mp4box-gen-opts/#new).  
The supported input media types depend on your installation, check [filters documentation](Filters) for more info.  
    
To select a desired media track from a source, a fragment identifier '#' can be specified, before any other options. The following syntax is used:  

- `#video`: adds the first video track found in source  
- `#audio`: adds the first audio track found in source  
- `#auxv`: adds the first auxiliary video track found in source  
- `#pict`: adds the first picture track found in source  
- `#trackID=ID` or `#ID`: adds the specified track. For IsoMedia files, ID is the track ID. For other media files, ID is the value indicated by `MP4Box -info inputFile`  
- `#pid=ID`: number of desired PID for MPEG-2 TS sources  
- `#prog_id=ID`: number of desired program for MPEG-2 TS sources  
- `#program=NAME`: name of desired program for MPEG-2 TS sources  

    
By default all imports are performed sequentially, and final interleaving is done at the end; this however requires a temporary file holding original ISOBMF file (if any) and added files before creating the final output. Since this can become quite large, it is possible to add media to a new file without temporary storage, using [-flat](mp4box-gen-opts/#flat) option, but this disables media interleaving.  
    
If you wish to create an interleaved new file with no temporary storage, use the [-newfs](mp4box-gen-opts/#newfs) option. The interleaving might not be as precise as when using [-new](#new) since it is dependent on multiplexer input scheduling (each execution might lead to a slightly different result). Additionally in this mode:   

    - Some multiplexing options (marked with `X` below) will be activated for all inputs (e.g. it is not possible to import one AVC track with `xps_inband` and another without).  
    - Some multiplexing options (marked as `D` below) cannot be used as they require temporary storage for file edition.  
    - Usage of [-cat](#cat) is possible, but concatenated sources will not be interleaved in the output. If you wish to perform more complex cat/add operations without temp file, use a [playlist](flist).  

    
Source URL can be any URL supported by GPAC, not limited to local files.  
    
_Note: When importing SRT or SUB files, MP4Box will choose default layout options to make the subtitle appear at the bottom of the video. You SHOULD NOT import such files before any video track is added to the destination file, otherwise the results will likely not be useful (default SRT/SUB importing uses default serif font, fontSize 18 and display size 400x60). For more details, check [TTXT doc](Subtitling-with-GPAC)._  
    
When importing several tracks/sources in one pass, all options will be applied if relevant to each source. These options are set for all imported streams. If you need to specify these options per stream, set per-file options using the syntax `-add stream[:opt1:...:optN]`.  
    
The import file name may be set to empty or `self`, indicating that the import options should be applied to the destination file track(s).  
Example
```
-add self:moovts=-1:noedit src.mp4
``` 

This will apply `moovts` and `noedit` option to all tracks in src.mp4  
Example
```
-add self#2:moovts=-1:noedit src.mp4
```  

This will apply `moovts` and `noedit` option to track with `ID=2` in src.mp4  
Only per-file options marked with a `S` are possible in this mode.  
    
When importing an ISOBMFF/QT file, only options marked as `C` or `S` can be used.

# Global import options  
  
<a id="add">__-add__</a> (string): add given file tracks to file. Multiple inputs can be specified using `+`, e.g. `-add url1+url2`  
<a id="cat">__-cat__</a> (string): concatenate given file samples to file, creating tracks if needed. Multiple inputs can be specified using `+`, e.g/ `-cat url1+url2`.    
_Note: This aligns initial timestamp of the file to be concatenated_  
<a id="catx">__-catx__</a> (string): same as [-cat](#cat) but new tracks can be imported before concatenation by specifying `+ADD_COMMAND` where `ADD_COMMAND` is a regular [-add](#add) syntax  
<a id="catpl">__-catpl__</a> (string): concatenate files listed in the given playlist file (one file per line, lines starting with # are comments).    
_Note: Each listed file is concatenated as if called with -cat_  
<a id="unalign-cat">__-unalign-cat__</a>: do not attempt to align timestamps of samples in-between tracks  
<a id="force-cat">__-force-cat__</a>: skip media configuration check when concatenating file.    

__Warning: THIS MAY BREAK THE CONCATENATED TRACK(S)__  
  
<a id="keep-sys">__-keep-sys__</a>: keep all MPEG-4 Systems info when using [-add](#add) and [-cat](#cat) (only used when adding IsoMedia files)  
<a id="dref">__-dref__</a>:    keep media data in original file using `data referencing`. The resulting file only contains the meta-data of the presentation (frame sizes, timing, etc...) and references media data in the original file. This is extremely useful when developing content, since importing and storage of the MP4 file is much faster and the resulting file much smaller.    
_Note: Data referencing may fail on some files because it requires the framed data (e.g. an IsoMedia sample) to be continuous in the original file, which is not always the case depending on the original interleaving or bitstream format (_AVC_ or _HEVC_ cannot use this option)_  
<a id="no-drop">__-no-drop__</a>,__-nodrop__: force constant FPS when importing AVI video  
<a id="packed">__-packed__</a>: force packed bitstream when importing raw MPEG-4 part 2 Advanced Simple Profile  
<a id="sbr">__-sbr__</a>:      backward compatible signaling of AAC-SBR  
<a id="sbrx">__-sbrx__</a>:    non-backward compatible signaling of AAC-SBR  
<a id="ps">__-ps__</a>:        backward compatible signaling of AAC-PS  
<a id="psx">__-psx__</a>:      non-backward compatible signaling of AAC-PS  
<a id="ovsbr">__-ovsbr__</a>:  oversample SBR import (SBR AAC, PS AAC and oversampled SBR cannot be detected at import time)  
<a id="fps">__-fps__</a> (string): force frame rate for video and SUB subtitles import to the given value, expressed as a number, as `TS-inc` or `TS/inc`.    
_Note: For raw H263 import, default FPS is `15`, otherwise `25`. This is accepted for ISOBMFF import but `:rescale` option should be preferred_  
<a id="mpeg4">__-mpeg4__</a>:  force MPEG-4 sample descriptions when possible. For AAC, forces MPEG-4 AAC signaling even if MPEG-2  
<a id="agg">__-agg__</a> (int): aggregate N audio frames in 1 sample (3GP media only, maximum value is 15)
